# Reproduces #11668
# When the view builder resumes building a partition, it reuses the reader
# used from the previous step but re-creates the compactor. This means that any
# range tombstone changes active at the time of suspending the step, have to be
# explicitly re-opened on when resuming. Without that, already deleted base rows
# can be resurrected as demonstrated by this test.
# The view-builder suspends processing a base-table after
# `view_builder::batch_size` (that is 128) rows. So in this test we create a
# table which has at least 2X that many rows and add a range tombstone so that
